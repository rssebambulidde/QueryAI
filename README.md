# QueryAI

A project repository with development and main production branches.

## Branches

- **main**: Production branch for stable releases
- **development**: Development branch for active work and integration

## Getting Started

### Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout the development branch: `git checkout development`
3. Create a feature branch from development: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes and commit
5. Push to development branch or create a pull request

### Branch Strategy

- All new features should be developed in the `development` branch
- Only stable, tested code should be merged to `main`
- Use feature branches for individual features or fixes
