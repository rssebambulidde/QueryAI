      "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. [Web Source 1](https://example.com/ml-basics) It uses algorithms to analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions based on that analysis. [Document 1] The field has applications in image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. [Web Source 2](https://example.com/ml-applications)",

      "question": "How does neural network training work?",
      "answer": "Neural network training involves feeding data through the network and adjusting weights to minimize error. [Document 1] The process uses backpropagation, where errors are calculated at the output layer and propagated backward through the network. [Web Source 1](https://example.com/neural-networks) During training, the network learns to recognize patterns by repeatedly processing training examples and updating connection weights. [Document 2] The goal is to find optimal weights that allow the network to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. [Web Source 2](https://example.com/training-algorithms)",

      "question": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      "answer": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, where each example has a known output. [Document 1] The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by finding patterns in the labeled training data. [Web Source 1](https://example.com/supervised-learning) Unsupervised learning, in contrast, works with unlabeled data and discovers hidden patterns or structures. [Document 2] It doesn't have predefined outputs to learn from, making it useful for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

      "answer": "To implement a REST API endpoint, start by defining the route and HTTP method. [Document 1] Use a framework like Express.js to handle routing and request processing. [Web Source 1](https://example.com/rest-api-guide) Implement the endpoint logic to process requests, validate input, and return appropriate responses with status codes.

      "answer": "Deploying a machine learning model involves several key steps. [Document 1] First, prepare the model for production by serializing it and creating a prediction interface. [Web Source 1](https://example.com/ml-deployment) Next, set up the deployment infrastructure, which may include containerization with Docker or cloud services. [Document 2] Implement monitoring and logging to track model performance and detect drift.
